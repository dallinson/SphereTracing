# Sphere Tracing
A project to visualise ray marching, a method of graphical rendering.  This specifically uses the "sphere tracing" method, however as this is entirely 2d circles are used to represent the ray steps instead.

## Controls

WASD to move the origin point; use the mouse to change the direction of the ray.  Left-click will place a circle of random size.
